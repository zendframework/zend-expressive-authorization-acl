For example, if a parking\nattendant requests access to a car, then the parking attendant is the requesting\nrole, and the car is the resource, since access to the car may not be granted to\neveryone.\n\n\nThrough the specification and use of an ACL, an application may control how\nroles are granted access to resources. For instance, in a web application a\n\nresource\n can be a page, a portion of a view, a route, etc. A \nrole\n can vary\nbased on the context in which the request is made: it could be the client\nidentity sent with an API request; whether the users is an \nanonymous guest\n or a\n\nregistered user\n of the site; etc.\n\n\nConfigure an ACL system\n\n\nYou can provide your ACL definitions using a configuration file, as follows:\n\n\n// config/autoload/authorization.local.php\nreturn [\n    // ...\n    'zend-expressive-authorization-acl' => [\n        'roles' => [\n            'administrator' => [],\n            'editor'        => ['administrator'],\n            'contributor'   => ['editor'],\n        ],\n        'resources' => [\n            'admin.dashboard',\n            'admin.posts',\n            'admin.publish',\n            'admin.settings'\n        ],\n        'allow' => [\n            'administrator' => ['admin.settings'],\n            'contributor' => [\n                'admin.dashboard',\n                'admin.posts',\n            ],\n            'editor' => [\n                'admin.publish'\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use this same example in the documentation of \nzend-expressive-authorization-rbac\n,\nso that you can compare and contrast the two systems.\n\n\n\n\nThe above configuration defines three roles for a blog web site:\n\nadministrator\n, \neditor\n, and \ncontributor\n. The \nadministrator\n has the\nhighest level of authorization (no parent).  A \ncontributor\n has the permission\nto create a post and manage the dashboard; its parent role is the\n\nadministrator\n.

By default, all resources are denied access,\nunless otherwise stated. In our example, we allow the route \nadmin.settings\n for\nthe \nadministrator\n, the routes \nadmin.dashboard\n and \nadmin.posts\n for the\n\ncontributor\n, and the route \nadmin.publish\n for the \neditor\n. Because the\n\ncontributor\n inherits permissions from \neditor\n, they will also have access to\nthe \nadmin.publish\n route. Because the \nadministrator\n inherits permissions from\n\ncontributor\n, they will have access to \nall\n routes.\n\n\nYou can also deny a resource using the \ndeny\n key in the configuration file.\nFor instance, you can deny access to the route \nadmin.dashboard\n by the\n\nadministrator\n by adding the following configuration in the previous example:\n\n\nreturn [\n    // ...\n    'zend-expressive-authorization-acl' => [\n        // previous configuration array\n        'deny' => [\n            'administrator' => ['admin.dashboard']\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\n\n\nThe usage of \nallow\n and \ndeny\n can help to configure complex permission\nscenarios, including or excluding specific authorizations.\n\n\nAs noted earlier, zend-expressive-authorization-acl uses the current route name\nto determine the resource. If you want to change the permissions type and the\nlogic for authorization, you will need to provide a custom implementation of\n\nZend\\Expressive\\Authorization\\AuthorizationInterface\n.\n\n\n\n\nzend-expressive-authorization-acl uses \nzend-permissions-acl\n\nto implement its ACL system.
